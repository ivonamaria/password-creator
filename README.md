# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

I have created a password generator for an employee so that they can create a random password based on
the information they have provided, such as: 

 * Generate a password when the button is clicked
 * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
 * Length of password
 * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
 * Character types
 * Lowercase
 * Uppercase
 * Numeric
 * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

It is a website operated application that runs in the browser.
